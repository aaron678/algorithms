A collection of Java algorithm tasks given in coding interviews. Some of these I've gotten personally in interviews and others I found during interview preparation. Of particular interest are the variations of the parentheses matching task.

Under src/com/study/algorithms/ are the following algorithmic task solutions.

	encode- Converts the individual chars of a string to their numerical representation. The key to this problem is not the algorithm which is simple, but in selecting a good data structure.
	
	factorial- Iterative and recursive solutions which calculate factorials.

	parens- Solutions to the classic parenthesis matching problem, including iterative, recursive and a solution using a stack.

	power- Calulcate the power of a specified base. Includes solutions of differing time complexities.

	prefix- Calculates prefix sums solutions of differing time complexities.

	primes- Calculates prime numbers with a version that improves on O(n) time complexity.

	reverse- A recursive solution and a solution that performs the string reversal in place. TODO- reverse the order of digits in a number utilizing the modulo operator.
